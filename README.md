# Filter-Bilateral-RGB-BW
The goal of this project is to denoise digital images while preserving edges. For that,
nonlinear filtering approaches should be used. Specifically, we would like to investigate a
filtering approach so-called "bilateral filtering" as described in "Tomasi_Manduchi_1998" article(attached) in both B&W images and RGB(color) images .
 
PDF of the final report that summarize purpose, results, conclusions and Extended explanation about the project:

In addition attach images before& after applying the filter (dogBW - filteredBW , noisyRubicsCube - filteredRGB) where you can see the diffrences. 
In order to run the code on an attached image, you must enter σ_r, σ_d represent the degree of influence of the geometric/photometric distance respectively between the two points in the sophisticated average. (as indicated in the attached summary report)
